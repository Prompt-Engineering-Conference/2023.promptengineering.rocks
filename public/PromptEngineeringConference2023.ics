DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Eric Elliott\n\nIn the rapidly-evolving landscape of 
 AI\, the way we interact with generative models significantly impacts the
 ir usefulness and the outcomes they produce. This session aims to shed li
 ght on a technique to streamline AI interactions: pseudocode prompting.\n
 \nNatural language is great for simple prompts\, but it often lacks the p
 recision required for more complex or algorithmic interactions. Enter pse
 udocode\, a simplified semi-formal language that can efficiently guide AI
  towards desired responses while following specific rules.\n\nThrough thi
 s session\, we'll discuss:\n\n* Principles of pseudocode prompting and ho
 w it improves reasoning performance over natural language prompts.\n* Pra
 ctical strategies and methods for generating and optimizing pseudocode pr
 ompts for various applications.\n* How pseudocode prompts can reduce toke
 n usage by 20-30%\, leading to decreased costs and faster responses.\n* H
 ow pseudocode can democratize programming\, making it accessible to a wid
 er audience by allowing the specification of requirements as natural-lang
 uage rules or constraints.\n* Illustrate how structured pseudocode offers
  easier navigation and maintenance of complex prompts compared to natural
  language through scope blocks\, indentation\, and visual encapsulation.\
 n* Enhancing Response Quality: Using structured templates and queries to 
 minimize poorly-formed responses and reduce token usage.\n\nThis session 
 will focus on the practical application of pseudocode in AI\, making it h
 ighly suitable for those interested in deploying more efficient and robus
 t AI applications.\n\nWhether you are a seasoned data scientist\, a devel
 oper looking for innovative ways to interact with AI models\, or simply a
 n AI enthusiast\, this session will equip you with fresh insights and pra
 ctical strategies for a more efficient AI prompting experience.\n\nhttps:

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Anastasia Podrabinek\n\nAs a Product Manager for AI t
 ools\, I see a lot of challenges arising when the uncertainties of AI wor
 ld meet the well-defined processes of classical engineering projects. The
 se challenges include: \n\n- The nondeterministic nature of natural langu
 age inputs and outputs\, that creates a lot of uncertainty and widens the
  gap between the working Proof-of-concept and a well-rounded enterprise l
 evel solution. \n- Roles shift: the prompt engineering and testing effort
  highly relies on team members without engineering background (content wr
 iters\, marketing professionals) who are experts in language but may lack
  familiarity with R&D processes.\n- Speed vs. Quality: this old as time c
 onflict creates more tension than ever when a company needs to adopt AI f
 ast without compromising the high quality and security standards\n\nAll t
 hese things create a lot of friction in big projects\, where previously t
 here was a smooth and clear way of planning\, execution\, testing and del
 ivery.\nIn this talk\, I'll suggest a few ways to optimize the work\, to 
 build good prompt evaluation processes\, to teach project teams about pro
 mpt engineering and to build a process in which prompt engineering is a n
 ormal\, well defined and somewhat predictable part of the workflow\n\nhtt

DESCRIPTION:Speakers: C Wen\, Zhaohong Wang\n\nIn today's fast-paced devel
 opment cycles\, product managers are often swamped with the task of conti
 nuously reviewing project tickets to assess the status and potential risk
 s. Our presentation dives into how prompt engineering can be a game-chang
 er in this process. Utilizing natural language processing\, we showcase a
  method for parsing and interpreting the vast array of project tickets to
  instantly categorize them based on urgency\, risk\, and other vital metr
 ics originated from internal hackathon project we did to help leadership 
 understand the risks of project from reading thousands of tickets in one 
 pass using LLM models. This enables product managers to make well-informe
 d decisions more efficiently. Furthermore\, we present a prototype of an 
 AI-powered assistant built on this methodology\, designed to assist produ
 ct managers in real-time project evaluation and risk management.\n\nhttps

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Daniel Kocot\n\nIn this session\, we will delve into 
 the practical and effective use of Prompt Engineering in designing detail
 ed\, accurate\, and user-friendly OpenAPI descriptions for APIs. OpenAPI\
 , a widely accepted standard for describing RESTful APIs\, plays a critic
 al role in API design\, development\, and usage. It allows both humans an
 d machines to understand and interact with the capabilities of a service 
 without direct access to the source code.\n\nHowever\, creating accurate 
 and comprehensive OpenAPI descriptions can be a daunting task. This is wh
 ere Prompt Engineering\, a cutting-edge technique\, can significantly enh
 ance the process. It enables AI models to understand and generate more ac
 curate\, contextually relevant responses\, hence perfect for crafting int
 ricate API descriptions.\n\nIn this session\, we will explore strategies 
 for translating API operations into natural language prompts\, effective 
 ways of refining API models based on generated prompts\, and practical de
 monstrations of how these techniques can improve the API development work
 flow. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of how to leverage AI an
 d Prompt Engineering in producing high-quality OpenAPI descriptions\, lea
 ding to better-designed\, more robust\, and easily understandable APIs.\n

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jan Krans\n\nIn a world where generative AI is reshap
 ing the boundaries of what's possible\, the power of prompting emerges as
  the game-changer. \n\nBut can it truly be a seismic catalyst for those w
 ith a growth mindset? \n\nThis session provides the answer by delving dee
 per into the transformative journey of harnessing generative AI\, not jus
 t as a tool\, but as a partner in exploration\, personal development\, an
 d growth. \n\nDive into a personal journey of rediscovery and innovation 
 as we explore 'Mystical Fusion' Tarot system\, not as an end product\, bu
 t as a testament to the creative learning process: the challenges faced\,
  the boundaries pushed\, and the lessons learned.\n\nFrom revisiting a de
 cades-old idea with limited to no programming experience to the triumph o
 f creating a tangible delivery of the project\, it's a story of resilienc
 e\, innovation\, and the boundless possibilities that emerge when a growt
 h mindset meets the right tools.\n\nBy the end of this journey\, what was
  once a hypothesis before the experiment is now proven\, culminating in a
  fully functional AI-powered Tarot app running on its own server in the c
 loud\, a physical deck of 52 cards\, a guiding e-book\, and a website\, a
 ll created during a 2 and a half week creative holiday break.\n\nThe proo
 f has been delivered. The power of prompting is rocket fuel for people wi
 th a growth mindset. The only limitation is your own creativity and energ
 y\, or like Charlie Chaplin once said: "Imagination is nothing without do
 ing".\n\nhttps://sessionize.com/live/qxazgepo540933
